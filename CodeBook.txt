Code Book
----------------

This is a code book describing the various variabls and data givien in the following 2 files - tidy_data.txt, tidy_data_avg.txt. 
For more details on this data set and expolanation - please see UCI dataset website (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

tidy_data.txt, tidy_data_avg.txt
--------------------

subjectID:    An integer number between 1 and 30 for each subject that had their data recorded. All subjects are from a group of 30 volunteers.

activity:  This is the activity taking place when the biomechanical measurements were taken:
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5.STANDING
6. LAYING

Measurement:    The feature being measured.
           
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Features containing 'Acc' is an accelerometer measurement
- Features containing 'Gyro' it is a gyroscope  measurement

The data has been subsetted to only show means and standard deviation measurements. The axis/direction is also included in this data column. 

Value: These are vaious measurements from the study. All values are between -1 and +1.


tidy_data_avg.txt
----------------

subjectID:   same as in previous 'tidy_data.txt'

activity:  same as in previous 'tidy_data.txt'

Measurement: same as in previous 'tidy_data.txt'

Avg_Value:  The average of the means across all vectors grouped by following variables: subject, activity, feature(Measurement)
